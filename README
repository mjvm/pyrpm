Usage
-----

        >>> from pyrpm.rpm import RPM
        >>> frpm pyrpm import rpmdefs
        >>> rpm = RPM(file('package-1.0-r1.i586.rpm'))
        >>> rpm.binary # this means that the package is a rpm and not a src.rpm
        True
        >>> rpm.name()
        'package'
        >>> rpm.package()
        'package-1.0'
